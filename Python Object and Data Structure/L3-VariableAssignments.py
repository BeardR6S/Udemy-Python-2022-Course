! Rules for Variables
! Names can NOT start with a number.
! There can be no spaces in the name, use _ instead.
--------------
! Rules for Variable Names
! Its considered best practice (PEP8) that names are lowercase.
! Avoid using words that have special meaning in Python like "list" and "str"
--------------
! Python uses Dynamic Typing
! This means you can reassign variables to different data types.add
! This makes Python very flexible in assigning data types, this is different than other languages that are "Statically-Typed"
